## CPSC 481 Project - Streamix HTPC
Our Streamix HTPC is an application created to make the experience of streaming, movies, TV shows, and music media more organized and enjoyable.

## Running Streamix
To run our application, either copy the link below (https://ug.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~bowofoluwa.ebynahisu/HTPC-main/HTPC/pages/home_page.html) or navigate to the file home_page.html and open with the user’s preferred browser. (We recommend Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge).

## Using the Streamix Application
By default, the user will be navigated to the homepage (the Movies & TV page). Before doing anything, hover over the profile icon in the top right corner and click on "Account & Settings" in the dropdown. This ensures that the local storage is empty.

From here, the user can navigate to any of the other tabs (Music or Videos) by clicking on their respective tabs.

In the top right corner, the user can see the search and profile icon. Clicking on the search icon takes the user to a search page where the user can look up items (See Searching). Hovering over the profile icon triggers a dropdown list with options for the user’s account like Lists, Ratings, Subscriptions, Account Settings, and Logout. 

In the main part of the home page (the Movies & TV page), we have sections where movies are allotted by differing criteria. The first section will always be a recommended section where its contents are targeted towards the individual user. The following sections are determined by other criteria like trending or highly rated.

We have a similar structure on the Music and Video page. On the music page there is a recommended albums section that is targeted and modified depending on the user. Then we have sections depending on the genre and music that is related and relevant to that season. Finally, we have a section that shows one of the lists created by the user.

On the videos page, we have a trending section followed by a section that contains live streams. Below will contain either a list created by the user or a Watch Later List. For all the pages to continue steaming or view descriptions regarding the content click on the poster for corresponding content. (Currently, we only have a few on each of the pages that are actually working).

## Searching
Searching is implemented through a search page. To access this page, the user must click on the spyglass icon on the top right, next to the profile icon.

To search for something specific, such as a movie or TV show for example, the user may enter its title into the search query below the media type and rating dropdown menus. Click Search to see the results.

For browsing purposes, the user can view available content using the media type or the rating dropdowns (Select Media Type and Select Ratings respectively). If the user selects a media type, a new dropdown menu will appear, Select Genre. This new dropdown will allow the user to further filter the results by the genres found within a specified media type.

## Creating and Using Lists
A feature of our HTPC application is to create and edit lists. However, before the user can add any items to a list, the user must create a list located on the My Lists page. The My Lists page is located in the dropdown menu after hovering over the user’s profile.

Before the user creates a list, they must select a media type for what contents are allowed in the list. Begin by heading to the My Lists page followed by clicking “Select Media Type” A dropdown menu will appear in the center of the screen, and select which media type the user desires for their list. Afterward, the user must name the list and click the Create list button.

To add content to a list, the user must head to the description page of the content the user wishes to add, select which list the user wants to add to from the dropdown menu accessed by clicking the box to the right of  "+ Watchlist" button, click the "+ Watchlist" button on the Movies and TV shows and "+ Playlist" on Music.

To edit a list the user must enter the list by clicking the desired list on the My List page. To remove an item from a list select the Red "X" button on the right of the item. To delete a list altogether, the user must click the red "X" button on the right of the list. 

## Subscriptions
User subscriptions are managed on the Subscriptions page. To access this page the user must navigate the cursor towards the profile icon. Hovering over it will reveal a dropdown menu. Click Manage Subscriptions to be taken to the Subscriptions page.

The subscriptions page displays the multiple services that the user can subscribe to. The user may subscribe to a service by clicking a subscribe button, located beneath the icon of a specific service. This will trigger a dropdown menu where the user is presented with varying subscription plans and their costs. The user should select the plan most tailored to their desired price range.
Please note that prices differ between services.

Unsubscribing from a service is a simple process. To unsubscribe from a service, click the unsubscribe button. A pop-up will appear, prompting for confirmation. Once confirmed, Streamix will unsubscribe the user from the service.

An alternative way to get to the Subscriptions page would be to click on an icon of an unsubscribed app within the Description page for a movie, television show, or music media.

## Rating
The user is given the option to rate the media through its Descriptions page and Streaming page.

–For Movies & TV–
On the Descriptions page, on the right of the Watchlist dropdown, Your Rating and five stars are present. 

–For Music–
On the Descriptions page, above the Watchlist dropdown, Your Rating and five stars are present. 

To assign a rating to the content, the user should select the number of stars the user thinks the item is valued, based on a standard five-star rating system.

The user can also view and delete ratings they have made on the My Ratings page. This page is accessible by hovering the cursor over the profile icon and selecting My Ratings in the dropdown list that appears.

## Playing Content
To play a movie, the user selects the poster that correlates with the movie the user wishes to stream, opening its description page. On the description page, select the icon of the service the user is subscribed to begin streaming (See Subscriptions if no subscribed service is available). The user can similarly play a TV show with an additional dropdown located below the Watch list labeled Episode List. The Episode List allows the user to select which episode the user wishes to watch.

Similarly, clicking on an album cover for any music will take the user to a description page where the user can see information about the music the user selected. Similar to the movies, the user can play the music by clicking the icon for any of the services the user is subscribed to. 

To play a video, the user clicks on the thumbnail for any of the videos the user wishes to view which takes the user to a streaming page where the user can play the video.
